# Customer-churn Project
**Project Introduction: Customer Churn Risk Identification**
This project was initiated by the Freebies WhatsApp Group with the objective of identifying customers at risk of churning. Recognizing the importance of customer retention for sustained business growth, our team focused on leveraging data to proactively address potential churn.
We utilized the Chinook Database as our primary data source. The data extraction process involved obtaining relevant customer, transaction, and behavioral information. Post-extraction, we meticulously cleaned and prepared the data using Python, ensuring its suitability for further analysis.
Through this project, we aim to provide actionable insights and strategies to mitigate customer churn, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty.
### Business Question 
Identify customers at risk of churning based on their purchase history and suggest targeted promotions to retain them
## Tools
- Python
- PowerBi

## DATA PROCESSING 
Understanding the business question I then accessed the chinook database to retrieve the customer and invoice dataset which was relevant to answer the buisness question.
I imported the neccesary libraies and then loaded the data into python and carried out the following processes:
- Removed the unwanted columns
- Formated data-types appropriately
- Renamed columns 

*Note*: for details of the data cleaning process check my notebook file.
After the data was succesfully cleaned, it was exported to csv file format and loaded into powerbi desktop for analysis.
